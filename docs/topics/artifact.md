# Artifact

An artifact is the result of a [Transformation](./transformation.md) for a specific context and/or object. It can be either plain text or JSON format.

!!!success Examples

- For a network device, you can use an artifact to track the configuration generated from a Jinja template (RFile).
- For a Security Device, an artifact can be the list of rules in JSON in the format of your choice generated by a Python Transformation.
- An artifact can also represent the configuration of a DNS server or the configuration of a specific Virtual IP on a load balancer.

!!!

While it's always possible to generate [Transformations](./transformation.md) on demand via the API, having an Artifact provide some additional benefits:

- **Caching**: Generated artifacts are stored in the internal [object storage](./object-storage.md). For resource intensive transformations, it will significantly reduce the load of the system if an artifact can be serve from the cache instead of regenerating each time.
- **Traceability**: Past values of an artifact remain available. In a future release, it will be possible to compare the value of an artifact over time.
- **Peer Review**: Artifacts are automatically part of the [Proposed Change](./proposed-change.md) review process.

While the content of an artifact can change, its identifier will remain the same over time.

## High level design

Artifacts are defined by grouping a [transformation](./transformation.md) with a group of targets in an *Artifact Definition*.

An **artifact definition** centralizes all the information required to generate an artifact.

- Group of targets
- Transformation
- Format of the output
- Information to extract from each target that must be passed to the transformation.
